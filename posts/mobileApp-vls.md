VLS, a.k.a **Vehicle Legal System**, is an assistant app for the organization administrators to keep track of the vehicle within their organization. VLS gives organization the ability to keep track of the legal information such as the Tax, Insurance, and other information as well. More than that, Administrators can posts their announcement or check the request notification from the other members within the organization as well. These the **techs** I used to built it:

- React: the main functionality
- Ionic: the component framework
- Capacitor: to use the native functionality such as Camera or Storage
- Firebase: for authentication and database usage.
- Visual Studio Code: IDE for editing
- Vercel: For Hosting

You can try it out via [VLS](https://vls.vercel.app)
