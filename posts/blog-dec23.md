There are so many things in my mind that I want to explore such as:
- ESP32 Python
- Raspberry Pi
- Nextjs
- Data Structure
- Object-Oriented
- Javascript

I probably have to learn how to divide my time more properly now toward each field. Aside from my exploration, I am still working my "My Tracker", I'm now stuck to think through whether I should make it for Offline Usage or for Online, well, I have to figure it out which one is more useful. Beside this, now I'm raising a rabbit in my room as well. For new owner like myself, I really surprise to see rabbit can poop between 125 balls and even more.
