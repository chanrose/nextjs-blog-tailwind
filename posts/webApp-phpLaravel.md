Alumni is an web application that built upon PHP Laravel with Bootstrap theme. It is a prototype in recording the graduate students so that it can be keep track and recall it anytime. It is built in with CRUD but without separate database yet. These the **techs** I used to built it:

- Heroku: for hosting
- Bootstrap: for theme
- PHP Laravel: the core component of the application
- Remotemysql.com: for database
- PHPstorm: IDE Editor
- Debian 10: Environment for local testing
