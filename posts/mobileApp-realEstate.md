Real Estate Broker, a place for buying or selling your estate with real time support agent to ease and smoothen the process. This app divided into 2 main accesses, one is the admin or agent and another one which is the user. The users will offer the post of their real estate property to, only after receive the confirmation from the admin or agent, will the posts be public. Before the posts be publicize the information will be verified hand to hand with the agent to make sure all the details are factual. Here is the **techs** I am planning to implement with:

- React: the main functionality
- Ionic: the component framework
- Capacitor: to use the native functionality such as Camera or Storage
- Firebase: for authentication and database usage.
- Visual Studio Code: IDE for editing
- Vercel: For Hosting
